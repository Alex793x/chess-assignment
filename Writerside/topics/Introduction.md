# Project Introduction: Exploring Chess with Bitboards and AI

### Introduction

Our objective is to develop a chess engine capable of playing challenging and well-informed games. 
We aim to achieve this by harnessing the combined strength of:

- **Bitboards:** Efficiently representing the chessboard for state information manipulation.
- **AlphaBeta Pruning with Heuristics:** Intelligently making well-informed decisions based on the game tree's assessment.
- **Extensive Move Generation:** Exploring a broad range of possibilities through comprehensive move generation.

### Methodology

- Studying and implementing Bitboard representation for effective chessboard manipulation.
- Exploring AlphaBeta search algorithms, designing efficient heuristics to guide the evaluation.
- Implementing move generation algorithms, ensuring our engine considers a wide range of options.
- Testing and refining the chess engine while evaluating performance and addressing issues.

### Outcomes

- Solid understanding of Bitboard representation and its advantages in chess.
- Functional AlphaBeta search algorithm with heuristics implementation.
- Well-performing chess engine capable of playing strategic, intelligent games.
- Valuable insights into applying AI techniques in game programming (specifically focusing on chess).

### Timeline and Deliverables

Phase 1:
- Research and study Bitboards, AlphaBeta pruning, and move generation algorithms.

Phase 2:
- Design and implement Bitboard representation for the chessboard.

Phase 3:
- Implement AlphaBeta search algorithm with initial heuristics.

Phase 4:
- Develop and integrate efficient move generation strategies.

Phase 5:
- Test and refine the chess engine, evaluating performance and addressing issues.

Deliverables:
- Final chess engine with source code, documentation, and final report summarizing project findings and contributions.

### Conclusion

This project offers our journey into chess programming and artificial intelligence. 
By harnessing Bitboards and AI, we aim to develop a robust chess engine capable of playing intelligent, 
challenging games. We are enthusiastic to embark on this discovery, learning, and creating a valuable contribution 
to game development.
